Make changes to some files which you have already added to Git once (i.e. they are not under the headline UNTRACKED in the output of git status).
Stash the changes you just made using Git.
Open the files you last edited and check if you can still see the changes
Edit the first sentence of the file story.txt in GitHub and create a commit.
Then edit the last sentence of the same file locally, but don’t create a commit.
Fetch the changes you made to story.txt in the remote repository to the local version. Use the stash.
After you have successfully fetched the changes to the local version, create a commit of the changes you made to the last sentence of story.txt.
Push the end result to GitHub.
Make sure you can see both the changes you made to the first sentence and the ones to the last sentence in the remote version.
If you see “CONFLICT” outputted to the terminal when popping changes from the stash, the section “Merge Conflicts” will help.
To submit, give the repository link, and make sure all the commits are there!
